# Medium Articles – Code Companion

This repository contains code, notebooks, figures, and supporting material for my Medium article series:

## *Thinking Like a Physicist in the Age of Data*

The purpose of this project is to bridge **physical reasoning**, **mathematical structure**, and **modern data analysis**, providing readers with a way to think rigorously about data beyond purely statistical or algorithmic approaches.

Each article is written to be readable as a standalone piece on Medium.  
Each accompanying folder in this repository provides the **technical, computational, and scientific backbone** that supports the ideas discussed in the text.

## Philosophy of the Project

Modern data science and machine learning are often taught as collections of tools.  
Physics, by contrast, is a way of *thinking* about systems, structure, constraints, and limits.

This project is built on the following principles:

- Data is generated by **systems**, not by spreadsheets  
- Understanding requires identifying **states, dynamics, noise, and structure**  
- Prediction is meaningful only when its **physical limits** are understood  
- Simplicity, scaling, and invariance often reveal more than complexity  
- Code should clarify ideas, not obscure them  

The goal is not to compete with existing ML tutorials, but to **complement them with physical insight**.

## How to Use This Repository

- Readers interested primarily in concepts can read the Medium articles independently.
- Readers who want deeper understanding can explore the accompanying code.
- Educators can reuse notebooks and figures for teaching.
- Researchers can adapt the examples as conceptual testbeds.

Each article folder is intentionally **self-contained**.

## Article Series Overview

Thinking Like a Physicist in the Age of Data. Each numbered folder corresponds to one article in the series.

- 01_Time_Series_Physics/
Introduces a physicist’s view of time series as projections of underlying dynamical systems, emphasizing states, memory, noise, and predictability horizons.

- 02_Noise_and_Stochasticity/
Explores noise as an intrinsic component of many systems rather than a mere measurement defect, highlighting ensemble behavior and stochastic dynamics.

- 03_Models_and_States/
Clarifies what physicists mean by a model, distinguishing structural assumptions from curve fitting, and examining hidden states and closure problems.

- 04_Scaling_and_Dimensionality/
Shows how dimensional analysis and scaling laws compress information, reveal invariance, and explain why many systems exhibit effective low dimensionality.

- 05_Spatial_Data_and_Fields/
Reframes spatial data as realizations of structured fields with geometry and correlations, emphasizing resolution, discretization, and correlation length.

- 06_Predictability_and_Chaos/
Concludes the series by examining chaos, sensitivity to initial conditions, and the physical limits of prediction, advocating honest uncertainty-aware forecasting.

- utils/
Shared helper functions and plotting utilities used across multiple articles. This avoids code duplication and ensures stylistic and conceptual consistency throughout the project.

## Intended Audience

This repository is intended for:

- Physicists working with data
- Data scientists seeking deeper conceptual grounding
- Machine learning practitioners interested in scientific modeling
- Advanced undergraduate and graduate students
- Educators designing physics- or data-oriented courses

No prior expertise in machine learning is assumed beyond basic familiarity with numerical computation.

## Reproducibility and Design Choices

- Dependencies are kept minimal and consistent across articles.
- Examples favor synthetic or semi-analytic systems.
- Code prioritizes clarity over performance.
- Notebooks are narrative and explanatory.
- The emphasis is on understanding before optimization.

## Future Extensions

This repository is designed to grow. Possible future additions include:

- Additional article series
- Teaching-oriented bundles
- Extended notebooks and exercises
- Cross-links to lectures or courses
- Translations and adaptations for educational use
