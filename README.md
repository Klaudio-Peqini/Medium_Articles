# Medium Articles – Code Companion

This repository contains code, notebooks, and supporting material
for my Medium article series:

## "Thinking Like a Physicist in the Age of Data"

Each subfolder corresponds to one article or short series and contains:
- Reproducible code
- Minimal examples
- Figures used or referenced in the articles

The articles are written to be readable independently of the code.
The code provides the technical and scientific backbone.

## Structure

- `Thinking_Like_a_Physicist/` – Main article series (read respective README.md for more clarity)
  
  `01_Time_Series_Physics/` - First article in the series setting the fundamentals of time series analysis and understanding

  `02_Noise_and_Stochasticity/` - Second article in the series dealing with stochastic data
  
  `03_Models_and_States/` - Third article in the series analyzing models and states of a system
  
  `04_Scaling_and_Dimensionality/` - Fourth article in the series analyzing the scaling properties of given data and models

  `05_Spatial_Data_and_Fields/` - Fifth article in the series discussing spatial data and typical features

  `06_Predictability_and_Chaos/` - Sixth article in the series analyzing chaotic systems and the limits they pose to predictability
  
- `utils/` – Shared utilities across articles
