# Medium Articles – Code Companion

This repository contains code, notebooks, and supporting material
for my Medium article series:

## "Thinking Like a Physicist in the Age of Data"

Each subfolder corresponds to one article or short series and contains:
- Reproducible code
- Minimal examples
- Figures used or referenced in the articles

The articles are written to be readable independently of the code.
The code provides the technical and scientific backbone.

## Structure

- `Thinking_Like_a_Physicist/` – Main article series
- `utils/` – Shared utilities across articles
