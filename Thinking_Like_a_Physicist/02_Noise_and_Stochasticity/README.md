# Noise Is Not an Error  
## A Physicist’s View on Stochasticity

This repository accompanies the Medium article:

**“Noise Is Not an Error: A Physicist’s View on Stochasticity”**  
(part of the series *Thinking Like a Physicist in the Age of Data*)

The article argues that noise is not merely a defect in data, but often an intrinsic and informative part of the dynamics of physical systems.

This repository provides the computational and conceptual support for that claim.

## Core Ideas

This project is built around several key principles:

- Not all noise has the same physical origin
- Noise can be intrinsic to the dynamics, not just measurement error
- Many systems require noise to function or evolve realistically
- Single trajectories can be misleading
- Ensembles and distributions often carry more information than smooth signals

The examples in this repository are intentionally simple, so that the role of noise remains transparent.
