# Predictability Is a Physical Property  
## Chaos, Horizons, and Honest Forecasting

This repository accompanies the Medium article:

**“Predictability Is a Physical Property: Chaos, Horizons, and Honest Forecasting”**  
(part of the series *Thinking Like a Physicist in the Age of Data*)

The article argues that predictability is not primarily a modeling or algorithmic issue, but a property of the underlying physical system itself.

This repository provides concrete examples showing why some systems are predictable only for limited times — regardless of data volume or model sophistication.

## Core Ideas

This project is built around several key principles:

- Chaos is deterministic, not random
- Predictability has a finite horizon
- Forecast accuracy decays due to dynamics, not incompetence
- Uncertainty grows even in perfectly known systems
- Honest forecasting requires understanding physical limits

The examples emphasize *why prediction fails*, not how to hide that failure.
