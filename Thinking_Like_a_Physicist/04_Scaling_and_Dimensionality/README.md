# Scaling Laws: The Language Beneath the Data  
## Dimensionality, Units, and Structure

This repository accompanies the Medium article:

**“Scaling Laws: The Language Beneath the Data”**  
(part of the series *Thinking Like a Physicist in the Age of Data*)

The article argues that scaling laws and dimensional reasoning are among the most powerful — and most neglected — tools for understanding data, models, and machine learning systems.

This repository provides concrete examples showing how scaling reveals structure that raw data often hides.

## Core Ideas

This project is built around a few central principles:

- Data without scale is meaningless
- Dimensionality is a physical and conceptual constraint, not just a number
- Scaling laws reveal invariances and governing mechanisms
- Many apparent complexities disappear when data is properly rescaled
- Ignoring units and scales leads to fragile models

The code focuses on *seeing* scaling, not just computing it.
