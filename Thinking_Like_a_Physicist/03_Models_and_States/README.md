# What Physicists Mean by a Model  
## States, Structure, and Understanding

This repository accompanies the Medium article:

**“What Physicists Mean by a Model: States, Structure, and Understanding”**  
(part of the series *Thinking Like a Physicist in the Age of Data*)

The article explores a fundamental but often misunderstood idea:  
in physics, a model is not merely a curve fit or a predictive tool, but a structured representation of how a system *is assumed to work*.

This repository provides concrete examples illustrating the difference between fitting data and modeling a system.

## Core Ideas

This project is built around a few central principles:

- A model is defined by its **assumptions**, not its accuracy alone
- States are internal variables, not always directly observable
- Good predictions do not guarantee good understanding
- Different models can explain the same data — and mean very different things
- Interpretability is a structural property, not an afterthought

The code emphasizes clarity over complexity.
